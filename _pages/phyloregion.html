    <span><code>phyloregion</code>, computational infrastructure for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology in the R computing environment</span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Establishing geographical comparisons based on shared biota is crucial to the study of biogeography and for managing biological diversity in the face of rapid warming of the Earth’s climate. However, the computational tools to analyze and manipulate the massive-scale species biogeography data have not been fully developed. The R software package <code><a href="https://phyloregion.com" target="_blank">phyloregion</a></code> – designed for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology – can overcome these computational challenges. It contains tools for biogeographical regionalization, macroecology, conservation, and visualization, with potential applications in various disciplines including evolution, microbial diversity, systematics, ecology, phylogenetics, and many others.

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Figure 1. Workflow to identify biogeographic regions using a Grade of Membership model. (A) Community matrix (optionally paired with phylogeny or functional traits) is (B) analyzed using a Grade of Membership Model, which allows the units of analysis (i.e., species or regions) to have partial membership in multiple clusters. (C) This generates values of omega (cluster contribution per grid cell) and theta (species’ contribution per cluster) as outputs. (D) Biogeographic regions are visualized using pie charts that represent the proportional contribution of species to grid cells.</figcaption>
