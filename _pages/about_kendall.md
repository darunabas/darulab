I joined the Daru lab in the Fall of 2021. I left the University of Miami as a Highlander with a B.S. in Plant Biology and am now in Corpus Christi as an Islander working towards a PhD in Marine Biology. I previously worked at the USDA Salinity Lab for Dr. Elia Scudiero researching soil spatial variability in citrus orchards, and now study the biogeography of arctic flora. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in arctic floristics, ecosystem modeling, and molecular phylogeny.
