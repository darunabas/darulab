    <span>Turning herbarium records into big data for plant microbiomes</span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Scientists are now discovering that the millions of biological collections kept behind the scenes in museums and herbaria can serve as a roadmap for understanding biological responses to global change. In this project, we propose to pull data from herbarium specimens to uncover the natural history of microbial diversity, which are not only crucial to plants for healthy growth and protection from herbivores, but, in turn, are useful as sources of new medicine in pharmaceutical industries.
