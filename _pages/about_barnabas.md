I was born in Kerang, Nigeria, a nice small town located about 54 miles south of Jos. I am interested in the ecology and biogeography of plants across ecological scales. I studied botany in Johannesburg. I was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, where I worked on new uses of herbarium specimens for ecology and evolutionary biology. My current research addresses the role of phylogeny in: 1) understanding how species are distributed, 2) conserving unique communities, and 3) understanding changing distributions in the Anthropocene. When not in the lab or field, I enjoy swimming, and spending time with my wife and two young kids.
