  <p style="margin-right: 50px;">Sophie is a junior majoring in Human Biology at Stanford University. Sophie is interested in microbiomes and their impact on human health. She previously worked as a Nutrition Research Student at the Stanford Nutrition Studies Group, where she contributed to a microbiome and nutrition study. She has also worked as a self-employed tutor, improving students' understanding of math, science, and writing. As an Exploratorium Explainer in San Francisco, she engaged visitors, conducted dissections, and taught biology, physics, math, and art concepts. Her desire to continue exploring the microbiome and gain wet-lab experience is why she joined the BSURP Program. Sophie's BSURP project in the Daru lab is to explore microbial symbionts of seagrasses from herbarium records spanning the last 100-200 years.
