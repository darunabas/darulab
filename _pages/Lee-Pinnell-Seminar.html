From the Gulf to cattle livers, microbes are everywhere and playing critical roles in ecosystem and animal health! We will discuss how the presence of plastic and bioplastic in the Laguna Madre impacted microbial communities in unexpected and important ways, how beluga whale and stingray-associated microbes are impacted by living in built environments, and how microbial dysbiosis in cattle may predispose them to diseases like bovine respiratory disease and liver abscesses.
