<h2>Turning herbarium records into big data for plant microbiomes</h2>
Turning herbarium records into big data for plant microbiomes.


Iâ€™m an aspiring neuroscientist and data scientist. In neuroscience, I analyzed and processed functional magnetic resonance imaging data. In data science, I utilized Python and R programming, Excel visualizations, and Orange data mining as part of my upcoming weekly data science project. I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
