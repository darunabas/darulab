Some of the recent and ongoing research projects in the Daru lab are as follows:

<h2> GreenMaps, a Tool for Addressing the Wallacean Shortfall in the Global Distribution of Plants</h2>
The exponential growth of species occurrence data can facilitate dynamic biodiversity analyses. However, raw biodiversity data alone should not be used indiscriminately due to inherent sampling biases, impediments that contribute to the Wallacean shortfall (i.e. the paucity of species’ geographic information). It has been suggested that the Wallacean shortfall is a common phenomenon across taxa, however, there is no global assessment geared toward overcoming this impediment for plants, despite the fundamental role of plants in ecosystem stability, food security and biodiversity conservation. Here, we propose GreenMaps, a new tool that will permit a rapid initial assessment of the Wallacean shortfall for plants by building base maps of species’ predicted distributions upon which citizen science participation could contribute to spatial validation of the actual range occupied by species. The initial stages of GreenMaps have now been accomplished, providing a massive dataset of modeled range maps for over 230,000 vascular plant species. This will make it the largest and only global assessment of geographic distributions for plant species at scales relevant to research and conservation. Ultimately, GreenMaps will interface with a mobile application to enable volunteers from any region of the world to validate predicted species distributions to be used for the generation of new and improved global maps of plant distributions.

<h2>phyloregion, computational infrastructure for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology in the R computing environment</h2>
Establishing geographical comparisons based on shared biota is crucial to the study of biogeography and for managing biological diversity in the face of rapid warming of the Earth’s climate. However, the computational tools to analyze and manipulate the massive-scale species biogeography data has not been fully developed. The R software package <a href="http://phyloregion.com" target="_blank">phyloregion</a> – designed for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology – can overcome these computational challenges. It contains tools for biogeographical regionalization, macroecology, conservation, and visualization, and has potential application in various disciplines including evolution, microbial diversity, systematics, ecology, phylogenetics, and many others. In this project, we plan to substantially increase computational efficiency of functions in phyloregion, to add new functionality, and create a model for user-guided software development in biogeography.<p>

<p>The project will accomplish the following: 
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol> >(1); <p>(2) Develop new tools in phyloregion to visualize patterns of biogeography, macroecology and evolution. Phyloregion will be enhanced to pass objects between R and RevBayes (a C++ tool for Bayesian phylogeography) for phylogeographic visualization through R; and <p>(3) Develop new tools in phyloregion for conservation that reflect the key dimensions of phylogenetic diversity including richness, divergence and regularity.
