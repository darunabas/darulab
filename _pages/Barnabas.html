  <p style="margin-right: 50px;">Barnabas has had a fascinating career journey, which has taken him from his undergraduate studies in Zoology at the University of Jos in Nigeria, to completing a Masters and PhD in Botany at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa. During his studies, he developed a keen interest in phylogenetics, biogeography, and macroecology of plants across different ecological scales. After completing his PhD, Barnabas was awarded a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University, where he focused on new uses of herbarium specimens for ecology and evolutionary biology. Currently, his research primarily focuses on the role of phylogeny in understanding species distribution, conserving unique communities, and comprehending changing distributions in the Anthropocene. When not in the lab or field, Barnabas enjoys swimming and spending quality time with his wife and two young kids.</p>
