  <p style="margin-right: 50px;">I am currently in my senior year at San Jos√© State University, pursuing a degree in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. My primary academic focus lies in the fascinating realm of microbes. I have previously been involved in studies related to bacteria and viruses, and I am eager to expand my horizons further.

My goals in the Daru Lab include enhancing my laboratory skills, honing my data analysis abilities, and expanding my collaborations. In addition, I aspire to gain valuable knowledge and exposure in the field of plant ecology.

Beyond academics, I cherish my free time spent in the company of my beloved cats and indulging in historical documentaries.
