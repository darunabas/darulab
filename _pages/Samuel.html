  <p style="margin-right: 50px;"><p>I am a rising Sophomore at Stanford University pursuing a double major in Earth Systems and Symbolic Systems. Through the BSURP program, I joined the Daru Lab in the Summer of 2023. In the past, during high school, I worked with mycology in Amazonia. My interests range from linguistics to ecology (especially mycology), passing through anthropology and biogeography. In the Daru lab, my research will focus on plant invasions and implications for biogeography in the Anthropocene.
