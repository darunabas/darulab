Dr. Walther's lab conducts research on a variety of topics related to fish ecology, migration, habitat use, food web interactions and environmental stressors. This work generally focuses on using the “natural tag” properties of carbonate hard parts in marine and diadromous fishes to examine patterns of migration, exposure to environmental stressors, and life history dynamics of species with mobile phases.
