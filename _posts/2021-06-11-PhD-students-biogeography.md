This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the
PhD Position in Biogeography

The Daru lab (https://barnabasdaru.com/) within the Department of Life Sciences at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is seeking a PhD student to begin in Spring 2022.  The student's research will focus on a 3-year NSF funded project to develop informatics tools and methods for biogeography (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835). 

The position includes a stipend ($24,000/yr), health insurance, and tuition. These will be provided through a research assistantship. The Daru Lab is supportive of opportunities for professional development (e.g., workshops and conferences). For instance, the student will also have funding to participate in a biogeography-method users workshop in Laguna Madre Field Station in the Gulf of Mexico in south Texas in Years 1 and 3 of the project and Turtle Cove Field Station, Louisiana in Year 2. We strive to provide a flexible, comfortable, inclusive environment for research and professional growth. The successful student will obtain Ph.D. degree through the Marine Biology Program, an interdisciplinary degree program.

Essential qualifications: 
Applicants should have: 1) A B.S. or M.S. in biology, ecology, evolution, biogeography, statistics or a related field; 2) An undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher.

Desired qualifications: 
1) Experience in spatial analysis and programming in the R computing environment; 2) Prior experience with GIS/geospatial analysis, R package development, Git, and/or reproducible research would be an asset. Prospective students from traditionally under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. 

Application:  
Applicants should electronically submit a single PDF file containing the following:
1) a 2-page cover letter detailing your research interests and explaining why you are a good fit for the position;
2) a CV or resume (with 3-5 references listed at the end).
