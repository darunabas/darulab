## Postdoctoral Position in Biogeographic Inference Tools (2 years)

A 2-year postdoctoral position in developing analytical methods and tools for evolutionary biogeography and macroecology is available in the lab of Barnabas Daru [(https://darulab.org/)](https://darulab.org/) in the [Department of Biology at Stanford University](https://biology.stanford.edu/). This position is part of a collaborative, NSF funded Division of Biological Infrastructure project titled *“phyloregion, computational infrastructure for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology in the R computing environment.”* The position is 100% research.

<!--more-->

The responsibilities are to: (1) Develop new methods for analyzing biome evolution; (2) Develop new tools to visualize patterns of biogeography, macroecology and evolution; and (3) Develop new tools for conservation that reflect the key dimensions of phylogenetic diversity including richness, divergence, and regularity  [(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835){:target="_blank"}.

The Daru Lab is supportive of opportunities for professional development (through [Stanford Office of Postdoctoral Affairs](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/)). The postdoc will also have the opportunity to participate in a users workshop on biogeographic methods held at Stanford Hopkins Marine Station and Turtle Cove Field Station, Louisiana. We strive to provide a flexible, comfortable, inclusive environment for research and professional growth.

**Essential qualifications:**  
Applicants should have a PhD in ecology, biology, evolution, biogeography, statistics or a related field, and have demonstrated expertise in spatial analysis and programming in the `R` computing environment. Prior experience with GIS/geospatial analysis, `R` package development, Git, and/or reproducible research would be an asset. Prospective postdocs from traditionally under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.. 

**Application:**  
Applicants should electronically submit a single PDF containing the following:
1. a 2-page cover letter detailing your research interests and skills that match the position;  
2. a CV (with 3-5 references listed at the end)

Please submit applications before **March 14, 2023** via [https://forms.gle/wKjNJHGcbfrJMXgQ7](https://forms.gle/wKjNJHGcbfrJMXgQ7){:target="_blank"}   
Direct any questions to Dr. Barnabas Daru at [bdaru@stanford.edu](mailto:bdaru@stanford.edu). The start date is **May 2023**, with flexibility.

**Terms of employment:**  
Salary, health insurance, and other benefits are included. This position is based at Stanford University, and it is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action/Veterans/Disability Employer committed to diversity.
