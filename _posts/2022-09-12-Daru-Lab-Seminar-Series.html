<h3><b><i>Linking taxonomy to genome traits across phylogenetic scales</i></b></h3>

After starting a career in pasture management in the Canadian prairies, I decided to pursue the study of sedges. This pursuit of understanding sedges has taken me across the world, from Canada's far north to South Africa and Central Europe. Sedges are not only interesting taxonomically, but their holocentric chromosomes are also intriguing. My most recent research position at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic focused on genome traits in sedges, as well as across all angiosperms.
