## PhD Position in Biogeography
Postdoctoral Position in Biogeographic Inference Tools (3 years)

A 3-year postdoctoral position in developing analytical methods and tools for evolutionary biogeography and macroecology is available in the lab of Barnabas Daru (https://barnabasdaru.com/) in the Department of Life Sciences at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.

<!--more-->

This position is part of a collaborative, 3-year NSF funded DBI project title *phyloregion, computational infrastructure for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology in the R computing environment*. The position is 100% research. The responsibilities are to: (1) Develop new methods for biome evolution; (2) Develop new tools to visualize patterns of biogeography, macroecology and evolution; and (3) Develop new tools for conservation that reflect the key dimensions of phylogenetic diversity including richness, divergence and regularity. 

The Daru Lab is supportive of opportunities for professional development (e.g., conferences).
The postdoc will also have the opportunity to participate in a biogeography-method users workshop in Laguna Madre Field Station in the Gulf of Mexico in south Texas in Years 1 and 3 of the project and Turtle Cove Field Station, Louisiana in Year 2. We strive to provide a flexible, comfortable, inclusive environment for research and professional growth.

Essential qualifications: 
Applicants should have a PhD in ecology, biology, evolution, biogeography, statistics or a related field, and have demonstrated expertise in spatial analysis and programming in the R computing environment. Prior experience with GIS/geospatial analysis, R package development, Git, and/or reproducible research would be an asset. Prospective postdocs from traditionally under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. 

Application:  
Applicants should electronically submit a single PDF containing the following:
1) a 2-page cover letter detailing your research interests and skills that matches the position;
2) a CV (with 3-5 references listed at the end)

Please submit applications to xx 
Direct any questions to Dr. Barnabas Daru at barnabas.daru@tamucc.edu 

The start date is September 2021, with flexibility.

Terms of employment: 
Salary of $40,000-$45,000 (depending on experience), health insurance, and other benefits are included.  This position is based at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.
