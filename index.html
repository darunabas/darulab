<p>The Daru lab at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi studies why plant species are distributed the way they are today, how they achieved this present-day distributions and how to set conservation priorities to safeguard their future. We integrate approaches from the fields of biodiversity informatics, herbarium collections, phylogenetics and genomics. We work in the field, the herbarium, the lab, and on high-performing computer clusters.
